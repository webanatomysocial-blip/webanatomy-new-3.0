Running an operation of this ambition requires more than a well-designed website; it requires a complete digital infrastructure. Web Anatomy designed and built both the public-facing marketing website and a full web application powering every function of the business, from parent enrolment to teacher management to a UV eye scan cafeteria payment system, and delivered the entire platform in twelve weeks."

It is a structured, premium activity centre where children explore and develop real skills and where parents expect the same level of polish in the experience as they see in the programming itself. Managing enrolments, sessions, attendance, payments and cafeteria operations manually was no longer viable at the scale they were growing."
        description2="The brief that came to Web Anatomy was one of the most technically layered we have worked on. Build a marketing website that reflects the brand's warmth and premium positioning. Then build an entire operational platform underneath it one that serves three completely different types of users, integrates with biometric hardware, handles real-time data across every function, and does all of it within a single cohesive product."

        description="The web application was architected around three distinct user journeys, each purpose-built for the person using it. Parents receive a seamless digital experience from discovery through to enrolment browsing activities, booking sessions, tracking their child's attendance and managing their wallet entirely online, without calls or paperwork of any kind."
        description2="Teachers are served through a dedicated portal designed around how they actually work, giving them full control over class management, session scheduling and student progress tracking in a single place. Administrators, meanwhile, have complete operational oversight of both the activity centre and cafeteria through a unified dashboard that brings every function of the business into one coherent view. Three portals, three distinct experiences, one unified system, built so that each user only ever encounters exactly what they need."

        description="The cafeteria payment system was among the most technically distinctive elements of the entire build, and one of the most considered in terms of user experience. Rather than children handling cash at the point of purchase, each student is identified through a UV eye scan, and the payment is deducted automatically from a pre-loaded parent wallet, with the transaction logged and visible to parents in real time."
        description2="Integrating biometric hardware into a live web application required precise coordination across identity verification, wallet management, real-time synchronisation and parent notifications, all within a single seamless interaction. The result eliminated cash handling from the centre entirely, gave parents complete visibility and control over their child's spending, and made every cafeteria transaction faster and more reliable than anything a cash-based system could offer."
